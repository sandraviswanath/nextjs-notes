Next js
next js is a full stack frame work
file based routing

how react works?
client side rendering
client(browser) request a page to server
the server gives html+bundle of js file
And the browser execute the js and shows the page.

how next js works?
srver side rendering
system(client) request a page ----> the page build by server and the page will be send to the client.so the initial load time is less.

react is not SEO frndly.
next js is SEO frndly.

 Dynamic Routing
 
 for dynamic routing--> useRouter is used for client components
 const router=useRouter();------> useRouter provided by next/router
 const{id}=router.query;
 or
 import { useParams } from "next/navigation";
 const { id } = useParams();
 
 useNavigation is used for server components
 const navigation = useNavigation();----->useNavigation provided by next/navigation
 const {id}=navigation.params;
 
 
 
 navigation--> when form submission
  const router=useRouter();
  router.push('/profile')
